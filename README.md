# Student-Mental-Health-Survey

This project analyzes a student mental health survey dataset to explore the impact of academic, social, and personal factors on mental well-being. Key areas of focus include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalized CGPA ranges and cleaned the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized distributions of mental health indicators such as depression, anxiety, and isolation, identifying trends and group differences based on gender, university, and residential status.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Found strong correlations between academic pressure and anxiety, as well as potential protective factors like social relationships.
- **Stress Relief Activities**: Analyzed how various stress-relief activities (e.g., religious practices, online entertainment) affect mental health.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Segmented students into mental health profiles using K-Means clustering, revealing groups with different stress levels.

The findings offer insights into the factors influencing student mental health and identify areas for intervention and support.
